Ship.IO offers seamless integration with GitHub.

## GitHub Add-On

You can connect or disconnect your Github account at any time by clicking "Add Ons" from the drop down menu.

## Repository Setup

When setting up a Job, we pull a list of your repositories from Github. All you have to do is pick the one that contains your mobile application and click "Create Job". Magical... kind of like unicorns.

## Using Organizations

We get it, you code with other people. That's why we help you setup Jobs for your Organizations too. When setting up your Job we let you toggle between your repositories and your Organizations' repositories as well. The setup process is so easy your CEO could do it.

## Commit Hooks

Ship.io has full support for commit hooks triggered by GitHub. Read about this feature here.
