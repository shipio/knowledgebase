Slack is a very popular platform tool for team communication.  We have an integration that will allow you to receive build notifications via a specific Slack channel! Oh yeah, real time notifications via Slack is here.

####Enabling Slack

To enable Slack please go to the Add Ons section via our menu and click the Connect button next to the Slack icon.

Follow the instructions on Slack to authorize your account to post to Slack.  Then you should see back on our Add on pages that Slack is connected.

To enable slack for your job, start by editing your Job and clicking "manage notifications".
From the Notifications dialog, select the Slack tab and enter the Slack Channel that you would like to receive build status notifications on.

Make sure you click the "Save" button once finished with your job settings.
That's it!  Now every time that specific job runs, you'll receive build process updates in that slack channel.
