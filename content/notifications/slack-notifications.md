Slack is a very popular platform tool for team communication.  We have an integration that will allow you to receive build notifications via a specific Slack channel! Oh yeah, real time notifications via Slack is here.

####Enabling Slack

1. To enable Slack please go to the Add Ons section via our menu and click the Connect button next to the Slack icon.
