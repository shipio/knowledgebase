####Build Notifications for OS X

Build Notifications for OS X was developed by one of our incredible users, [Romain Pouclet](https://github.com/Palleas), and allows you to receive notifications on your desktop whenever a build is kicked off or finishes. It even tells you if your build passed or failed!

The application is open source and can be found on Romain's GitHub [here](https://github.com/Palleas/cisimple-notifier) or our fork [here](https://github.com/shipio/shipio-notifier).
