Ship.io has support for email notifications on certain build events.

To start managing your email notifications, go to the Edit Job page and click the "Manage Notifications" link above your job name.

You're now able to configure email notifications for your job. In the "Emails" input, list the email addresses (space delimited) that you would like to be notified when certain build events take place.

You can also specify which build events you would like to be notified about. You can choose between:

- When a build takes place (you'll be notified for every build)
- When a build fails
- When the build status changes (passing -> failing, or failing -> passing)

If you would like to completely disable email notifications for your job, remove all emails from the emails input.
