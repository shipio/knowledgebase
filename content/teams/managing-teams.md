Teams are designed for groups of developers that would like to share their jobs, enabling multiple people to collaborate and manage builds together. When creating a team you can decide which Jobs to share and which people have access to them.

1. From the Ship.io drop down menu, select "Teams".

4. Let's add someone to our Team by entering their email address and clicking Invite.                                              

5. If the email address you invite already has an account in Ship.io they will automatically be added as a member to your Team, otherwise they will be sent an invitation via email. When a user you have invited creates their Ship.io account, they will automatically become a member of your Team. You can add and remove members and invitations at any time.

6. Now, let's share a Job with our Team by clicking the "Add Job" button and selecting the Job we want to share.
